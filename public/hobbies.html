<h1>My Hobbies <hr /></h1>

<p>Web/Mobile app development:</p>
<p>First main interest is bringing some of my web/mobile app ideas to life.</p> 
<p>Exercise:</p>
<p>Been an athlete most of life, so typically like to maintain an aesthetic.</p>
<p>Video Games/Controllers:</p>
<p>If there is anything that I collect, that would be controllers, and this even goes down to working on them too. When they brake down
   I fix, mod or upgrade them. I aspire to build my own controller and even a few thumbstick accessories. Since I am fascinated by them.
   After working my controllers, I test them on video games I enjoy which may be Call of Duty or some fighter games.
